how to add.

Save files as you go through

1. Add model file
2. Edit Model file to include the particle line (copy paste from others)
3. Add texture file


4. Copy paste the item model from models/item that best suits the mob.
They have been translated already (How you see them in your inv, on the ground ect...).
Ie:   Chicken for 1 block tall mobs
      Creeper for 2 block... ect....
You will still need to adjust it in game to get accurate results.
5. change the parent inside the file
6. Rename the file along with others down this checklist to match with the other mobs (just follow the pattern).
7. in the 'lang' folder you'll find 'en_us.json'
8. Add a line with a comma and change the type to the mob
9. Copy paste a blockstate file, rename and change insides as per usual.

10. In the main java\net\runedar\snr open SnRClient and add the statue to the render layers (don't forget the comma.)
11. under \blocks Copy paste one of the files (this file includes Voxel/hitbox stuff, so choose the most similar statue size)
12. Change the 2 lines of the 'mob' inside the file; ie, CreeperStatueBlock -> AxolotylStatueBlock

13. Under Registry, copy paste the specific contents inside MobBlocks and MobItems that match with the mob's name,
the pattern should be obvious enough (dont forget commas when necessary)
14. Make sure resources\assets\statuesnrunes\data\statuesnrunes\loot_tables folder is also changed


15. In game you can mess with the Voxel/Hitbox shape and mess around with inventory viewing.
